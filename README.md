# Model
The codes are designed for the model LW-GNN<sub>GCN</sub>, which is the variant of LW-GNN. It replace the GCNII with general GNN for homophilic graphs.

# Dataset
The folder "data" contains the homophilic dataset Cora. For this dataset, there are two files named "data.cites" and "graph.content".

* .content: Each line represents the text information of a vertex. [num_of_paper, text_features, type]
* .cites: The edgelist file of current social network.


## Run
Run the following command for training CANE:

    python3 run.py  -- batch_size 8 --lr 0.001 --epochs_p 50 --epochs 100 # toyLWGNN
